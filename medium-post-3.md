# Milo Yiannopoulos is Different, Should He Still Be Allowed to Speak
For about a year now, infamous alt-right and former Breitbart contributor Milo Yiannopoulos has been making headlines with his “Dangerous Faggot” speaking tour (his words not mine) taking place on college campuses across the country, and incendiary remarks that have pissed off just about everyone from feminists to blacks to gays to college kids and everything in between. This provocation has resulted in a whirlwind of controversy that follows him to every appearance, at times creating protests, violence, and the occasional “disinvitation” to speak. But politics and controversy aside, is there a greater issue taking place beneath the slicked back bleach blonde hair of modern politics supervillain among our academia?

I have to steal from a school down the road from me, but I believe what Thomas Jefferson said about the University of Virginia demonstrates how freedom of expression should be protected on campus: “This institution will be based on the illimitable freedom of the human mind. For here, we are not afraid to follow truth wherever it may lead, nor to tolerate any error so long as reason is left free to combat it.” At the time, Mr. Jefferson was commenting on student’s right to get an education free from religious influence, but it can be more broadly applied to the idea that colleges are centers of academia where a person’s rights are at their most protected.

That brings us to the issue of Mr. Yiannopoulos — his right to speak on college campuses, and what students appropriate behavior should be, whether they support his views or not. In order for that to happen in today’s society, students must understand that universities are institutions of higher education meant to foster learning and encourage new and diverse ideas, and accept that, for this environment of scholarship to be achievable, the rights of all must be exercised to their fullest. This means that Mr. Yiannopoulos’ right to speak on campuses does not have to be celebrated, but it must be respected, because as radical as his views are, they are still teaching moments for students that bring a new perspective on the political issues we are facing.

Keep in mind this is coming from a student who disagrees with Mr. Yiannopoulos on almost everything he says. My opinion of the man hovers somewhere between disapproval and outright disgust depending on the current headline, but overall not a very high impression of the man. I’m also here to say that my opinion does not matter. It is simply not right to ban him from expressing himself and his views on campuses, which in theory should be the most open-minded places our society has to offer. Yes, he has done antagonistic things like secretly join protests and openly mock others to incite reactions, and if these do in fact create a dangerous situation, he should be promptly removed to defuse the conflict. It saddens me though that students often protest his speeches with violence and a blatant disregard for freedom of expression. Freedom to assemble and petition are also within the rights of students, but not to do so violently, and to do so targeting their own peers who they may not share the same views as is simply appalling. It is at that point that these overzealous students slip below the level of Yiannopoulos to become even larger monsters than the man they seek to protest.

This doesn’t just happen around Yiannopoulos though, in fact, just a week ago, student protesters at Middlebury College were so disruptive they injured a professor and were successful in shutting down a talk by Charles Murray, a conservative social scientist. Soon afterwards, an editorial published in the Wellesley College student newspaper caught flack for essentially championing a doctrine of political correctness at the expense of freedom of expression. What these students so often fail to see is that these ideas that challenge their way of thinking should not be treated as dangerous, but as opportunities to learn, and that the developing homogeneity of their views are the real danger to higher education.

Take heart though because the second half of Mr. Jefferson’s quote provides a little bit of insight into what the dutiful student should do when presented with such a difficult conundrum, “we are not afraid to follow truth wherever it may lead, nor to tolerate any error so long as reason is left free to combat it.” And combat it students can! Rather than writing an editorial that is in effect taking a crybaby approach to the issue, toughen up, think harder, and (academically) fight for you views! That is why freedom of expression is so important on college campuses; it allows for rhetoric and debate, which make us uncomfortable but also enhance our experience as students as we begin to formulate and develop new and better ideas — something I believe Mr. Jefferson would be very excited about.
