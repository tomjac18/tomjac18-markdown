## Has the Internet Hurt Freedom of Expression
When the internet became a household phenomenon in the 21st century, it provided people all over the world the opportunity to become more connected, share new ideas, and learn from each other. At the same time, it has grown into this global platform for the sharing and expression of ideas and content that past generations could never have even fathomed. Everything from recipes to petitions, to funny pictures of cats dressed as humans are within a few keystrokes and a google search. The access we have to information and our ability to share our opinions with the world simply amazes me, but is there a danger hidden beneath this wonderful web of knowledge.

In our podcast (if you haven't listened to it, find it here LINK), we interviewed Dr. Wat Hopkins, a communications professor specializing in communication law and freedom of expression and he brought up some really interesting points on the evolving challenge of protecting freedom of expression on the internet and social media. One of the major issues of the dissemination of ideas and opinions in the online platform is that the internet has evolved so quickly and grown in popularity faster than our judicial system can determine how to rule on it.

See, when defining what constitutes freedom of expression versus dangerous or hateful speech, Dr. Hopkins used a few court cases ruled on by the Supreme Court that have provided tests and precedents for trials ever since. Notably, there was Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District (LINK) that produced the famous "students do not shed their constitutional rights at schoolhouse gate" and has been used as legal precedent involving freedom of expression on schools and college campuses since the 1970s and the more controversial Texas v. Johnson in which symbolic political speech was differentiated from threatening or hateful speech. The problem with the internet is that in the past, threatening speech has easily been separated from freedom of expression. Burning a cross in someone's front yard or yelling obscenities at another person on the street is not okay because it can incite violence, or cause harm or fear, and usually someone can be held accountable for such behavior. The internet has blurred the lines of what threatening speech can be.

The major difference between threatening someone over the internet versus face-to-face is that their is a level of anonymity on the internet that makes the perpetrator feel comfortable. They can attack someone with very little chance of ever being caught unless it can be proved beyond a doubt that they were serious in their comments and it was a targeted attack, which in most cases has to be repeated harassment. Most everyone who has played video games online has either been a victim or a perpetrator of threatening someone else with violence, that is just the nature of competitive games, or a political disagreement on Facebook could suddenly to nasty in the comments section. The issue is that people are less likely to check their emotions and will say whatever they feel when their is a screen between them and others, regardless of how it makes other parties involved feel.

The issue from a judicial standpoint is that there is hardly any legal precedent when dealing with freedom of expression on the internet. Outside of extreme cases like obscenities and misleading commercial speech it turns out it actually very hard to nail down anonymous people over the internet and get them to admit threatening speech with malicious intent. The traditional tests developed for freedom of expression cases have had a difficult time being applied to cases on the internet. Nothing against the lapse in foresight of our past justices, no one could have anticipated the internet nor its profound impact on society. What we need to do now is begin prosecuting freedom of speech cases on the internet so that we do establish precedents- I'm looking at you Google and Facebook, a powerful advocate in the private sector of the internet would go a long way in helping to establish what freedom of expression looks like on the online platform.

I'm not saying the internet is a modern day wild west filled with scary bad guys and a general lawlessness. A vast majority of it is a safe place to share thoughts and ideas and it has done so much good for the world through its ability to disseminate information. And a small sense of anonymity can be a good thing to, it has certainly made it more likely for me to share different issues I feel strongly about, whether that is signing petitions online or sharing a link to political editorial I like. Its when people start to attack each other with very little fear of culpability that we see the problems of an internet in which freedom of expression has yet to be defined, and its up to our government to solve that.
